        Our goal is to build ideas into successful companies. We combine skills and capital to rapidly execute on an emerging technology. It’s a place where multiple ideas are build to product/market fit. After this seed stage, they debut as independent startups.

      <h2>Technology pushes humanity forward</h2>
      <p>
        One thing in history has consistently increased human wellbeing. The progress of technology. It’s what pushes humanity forward. That’s why we use technology to make the world a little better. It’s what we call ‘creating positive impact’. To disrupt is to change things for the better.

      <p>
        Experience has shown us repeatable elements in building a tech startup. Based on these insights we’ve developed an analytical process, which we call the ‘venture creation flow’. Success and failure will continu to improve the steps in building a company. We will build several companies in parallel, but always with a dedicated founder from our studio.

      <h2>The perfect co-founder of a seed stage startup</h2>
      <p>
        As a studio we co-found a startup with an entrepreneur who is a specialist in his field. We build the startup from idea to product/market fit over a period of 24 months.  This makes them ready for growth investment (Series A). After this period we deliver an independent startup with traction, a complete team and a working product.
