        Our studio builds ideas into successful companies. We combine skills and capital to rapidly execute on an emerging technology. It’s a place where multiple ideas are build to product/market. To build a company we follow an analytical flow to learn and continuously improve. After the seed stage, our startups debut as independent companies.

      <h3>How?</h3>
      <h2>Following a process for progress.</h2>
      <p>
        Our experience as entrepreneurs has taught us that progress comes from the right combination of technology, design and traction. This is what moves things forward. Our studio provides what’s needed to get from an idea to a company. We follow an analytical venture flow to get from A to B. It enables us to build several companies in parallel. This process improves with every startup we do.

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <h2>The perfect co-founder of a seed stage startup.</h2>
      <p>
        As a studio we co-found a startup with an entrepreneur who is a specialist in his field. Together we build the startup from idea to product/market fit over a period of 24 months. This improves the chance of a startup getting through the rollercoaster. After this period they debut as an independent startup with traction, a complete team and a working product. We make technology happen.
