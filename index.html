      <h2>Technology pushes humanity forward.</h2>
      <p>
        One thing in history has consistently increased human wellbeing. The progress of technology. It’s what pushes humanity forward. That’s why we use technology to make the world a little better. It’s what we call ‘creating positive impact’. To disrupt is to change things for the better.

      <h2>Following a process for progress.</h2>
      <p>
        Our experience as entrepreneurs has taught us that progress comes from one main thing. The right combination of technology, design and traction. This is what moves things forward. We follow a structured process to get from an idea to a product and move on to become a company. Or even lead a new industry. This venture flow will improve with every startup we do.

      <p>
        It all starts with an specialist entrepreneur and a big idea. Our studio adds skills and capital where needed. Building the product, getting traction and making it spin. This improves the chance of a startup getting through the rollercoaster. Our startup studio goes by the name Backspace. It’s our favourite key on the keyboard.
