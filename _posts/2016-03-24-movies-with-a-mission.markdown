There are many ways to tell a story. Books, articles, infographics, but movies do a great job in just 90 minutes. It serves the attention span of most people today. Time moves fast, so taking a week to read a book isn’t people’s first priority.

As a studio we build companies to create positive impact. So that usually starts with attention for the problem, before you can build the solution. These movies have inspired us to make a change. It’s interesting to see these niche platforms for smaller quality made films popping up like https://mubi.com, http://www.moviesthatmatter.nl, http://cinetree.nl

Each of these movies put the spotlight on where it hurts. Changing the perspective. Real movies with a mission. They also relate to the industries we focus on. Most of them are available on Netflix or just order the old school DVD.
