That’s a fact many of us don’t swallow easily. It’s a no-brainer to prove the opposite by switching on the news or scanning headlines. Fortunately, there is Hans Rosling, professor of Global Health in Sweden. Master of statistics and stories. As always, he can make it crisp and clear in an entertaining way. 

Rosling founded Gapminder, an NGO that publishes visualisations from immense data sets to track global health and poverty trends. His images show that deaths from natural disaster, as well as global poverty dropped tremendously the past century. He’s about rational optimism. Don’t take his word for it, the facts and figures speak for themselves.

We don’t read about this for a number of reasons:
* We suffer from a cultural bias - in other words: we have strong assumptions that guide how we interpret facts
* News media suffer from the same bias - the angle is not always ‘positive news’
* Some teachers rely on outdated worldviews and facts they were taught themselves

What to do? We cannot rely on the storytelling skills of a Swedish professor’s TED-talks. What we can do is challenge some of the misconceptions deeply rooted in many of our brains. Here are Ola Rosling’s (yes, son of) four heuristics to help you see the world systemically different:

* Everything gets worse > most things improve
* Growing gap rich and poor > the gap is closing
* Countries get rich first, act social second > countries get social first, rich second
* Sharks are dangerous > sharks kill very few

It’s tempting to immediately play down this positive worldview, but that only shows how engrained these concepts are. Focus on the facts, not the opinions. At least in our brains here, at the studio. So we’re doing our utmost best to not only challenge them by thinking that most things improve, but hopefully also improving things ourselves.
