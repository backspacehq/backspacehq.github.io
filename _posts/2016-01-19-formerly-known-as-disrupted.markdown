The studio formerly known as Disrupted, now goes by the name Backspace. Why? Let me explain.

We tried the name Disrupted for a year and it didn’t really work for us. The word has dilapidated into corporate consultant lingo, it’s hard to pronounce and it carries somewhat of a negative connotation. So we stopped complaining and did something about it. You can’t really escape the bullshit bingo, but you don’t have to put it into your name... Nothing really changed. Same vision, same people, only a different name.

We still agree with Schumpeter on his ideas of ‘[creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction)’. Everything changes all the time. It’s the only constant in this world. Sometimes, you need to break something in order to rebuild something better. Modern systems like [Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy) are great tools for us to adapt to this continuous change. Expect to find our Playbook here soon.

Our story started with just three guys, but now the team is growing. Kicking off the New Year with a fresh start. We won’t make it a yearly thing though: our ambition is to grow the Backspace brand into a seal of quality, just like Taschen is for books or Blizzard is for games. We aim to be the seal for ‘quality-made tech companies’.

Backspace feels right. It’s been our icon since day one, because it’s our favourite key on the keyboard. It enables you to rethink and redo. Now it’s our name as well.

To new beginnings.

Be well,

**Backspace**<br>
A startup studio.<br>
Rethink. Rebuild. Repeat.
