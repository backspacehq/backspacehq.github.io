As entrepreneurs, we have a thing for anyone who can turn ideas into tangibles. Oddly enough, it can be tough to find illustrators, animators, photographers, developers, product designers.

Many creatives can set up shop from virtually anywhere. Most tools fit their laptop aka mobile studio. They don’t need intermediaries to find commercial jobs. Wifi is enough. 

For studios like ours, Dribbble, Behance, Github or Cargo Collective are default online destinations to spot talent. These platforms are also a place to get totally lost in the quantity of featured work. 

Other strategies we’re using are asking around in personal networks and scouring design blogs. Still, a match seems to rely more on faith in serendipity, than some sort of structure. The problem we see is the overload of visual content and the lack of a single touchpoint.

And so we wonder: is there a better way to great karma-matches between companies and creatives? Between the ones who have the work and do the work. Where can we increase transparency when the default gateway is digital or an intermediary?

We thought we’d start with sharing makers we love. Makers we know personally. Or makers' work we just really like. Makers who bring us in flow, because we bring them in flow*. 

Who are we missing? Please [get in touch](mailto:hello@backspace.studio) to complement the list. We’ll make sure to update. And who knows build a curated marketplace along the way. One touchpoint to turn ideas into tangibles.

Of course, we’re looking to improve our chances of supporting makers in feeling challenged, focused, creative and alive. Not only by what we ask from them, but also by exposing them to potential collaborators.

*Flow being this state when what you’re doing is exactly challenging enough for your particular skill set to forget about time, space and practically everything else.
