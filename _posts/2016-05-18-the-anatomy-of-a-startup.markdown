Every startup team in technology knows the odds are against them. Failure rates of first-time entrepreneurs are dauntingly high. Needless to say it takes advanced skill to turn a great idea into a great company. First-time entrepreneurs are often unaware what skills are vital when in the process of building their venture. 

This is a basic template from our studio model to asses startup skills and roles that need to be filled, divided over three equally important pillars: technology, design and traction. It’s the right combination that makes it work. To decrease the risk of failure, all roles in these pillars need to be filled, right from the start. No concessions.  ‘Culture’ and ‘Operations’ tend to be forgotten, but are essential for a fast growing company.

Practically, it works as follows:  

1. Startup members add their skills to the role template.
2. The studio (red) covers the roles not covered by the startup (green). > 40% startup/60% studio

3. Progress is reflected by how many of the roles move from studio to startup

4. After 24 months, all roles are filled by a balanced, stand alone startup team. The studio is there for long term guidance. > 90% startup/10% studio

Our goal is to get a startup to product/market fit in 24 months. This means a working product, measurable traction and an operational team. We support entrepreneurs by bridging the gap in skills and capital they’re facing. We don’t run startups in-house, but with an entrepreneur who is a specialist in his field. Together, we build an idea into a running company with positive impact. A bit like the [B.Corp way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-VFZUFJwt4); ‘Doing good, by doing well.’ 

The studio provides a runway for the startup to build the [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and offers the investment opportunity to our investor network from day one. This gives the entrepreneur focus, in a time when he or she should be focussed on building product and getting traction. In this process it’s important to have the priorities straight. This is what matters most to investors:

1. Traction
2. Team
3. Product
4. Social proof of the product
5. Pitch

Our studio team is built around the same model. We are a boutique of specialists ordered along these five pillars. This way, startups have advanced skills literally at hand. Whether in funding, development, growth hacking or storytelling. They get skills on recipe. Less waste, more taste.

We share these resources, based on the assumption that what’s valuable to us, might have something in it for you, too. Reach out to [jons@backspace.studio](mailto:jons@backspace.studio) for clarifying questions or things we missed.
