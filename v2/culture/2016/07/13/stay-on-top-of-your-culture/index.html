      <p>What is the meaning of work? Of life? We don’t have clear-cut answers, but it’s more than just trading your time for money. We do have an innate desire to explore these questions. At home and at work. Creating a positive culture for the things you can influence.</p>

<p>Purpose, mission, North Star, BHAG, vision, calling, legacy: they’re all different ways to feel good about how you’re spending your days. To do this on a personal level, is not easy. To do this on a company level, is even harder.</p>

<p>At Backspace, we decided not to ignore how we, as individuals, ideally spend our lives. The tension between everyone’s aspirations and daily life at the studio fuels our work. You need to be explicit to turn obstacles into opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="how-purpose-comes-with-profit">How purpose comes with profit</h3>

<p>For that reason, we keep track of head and heart; performance and happiness; profit and purpose; productivity and engagement. Because we see that profit and purpose aren’t mutually exclusive. They’re force multipliers.</p>

<p>This post shares the tools we used over the course of a six-month experiment to further define our company culture. We hope the learnings benefit you, too.</p>

<p>OK, the mini-course starts now:</p>

<h3 id="values-are-the-foundation-of-culture">Values are the foundation of culture</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A company is a group of people collaborating to reach a shared objective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a dry way of putting it, but definitions help to talk about companies a bit more theoretically.</p>

<p>Formulating that objective on different levels helps to see how day-to-day work eventually contributes to something bigger than ourselves. Disclaimer: these are the words we use, because they worked for us. You can wordsmith them forever. We just recommend taking the effort to verbalise these three ‘levels’:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Imagine the sky at night. Squinting your eyes, you see a bright star blinking: a beacon for where you’re headed on the long-term. That’s your purpose. It’s your reason for being.</li>
  <li>Now look at your feet, standing firmly on the ground. You know exactly what and what doesn’t knock you off balance. Those feet, are your values. They’re timeless. Non-negotiable.</li>
  <li>In between that star and your feet is a pretty open space, not? Which is fine, until you need to pick a left, or a right. The compass for those moments is your mission.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tools-to-make-your-purpose-explicit">Tools to make your purpose explicit</h3>

<p><strong>Star (purpose)</strong>: it’s your company’s reason for being, the change you want to see in the world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activity: our team worked on finding out how everyone’s individual strengths, moments of flow and sense of meaning overlap. That sweet spot could be defined as a personal purpose.</li>
  <li>Tool: Meaning Canvas (image below).</li>
  <li>Example: one team member’s personal purpose is to inspire people to experiment, because it combines a strength (creativity) with flow (one-on-one conversations) and sense of meaning (experimenting leads to entrepreneurship).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../../../../uploads/Meaning&#32;Canvas.001-572a9c.png" alt="Meaning Canvas.001-572a9c.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Feet (values)</strong>: principles or standards of behaviour that show what is important in life to someone. A great company value needs to be maintained forever, applies to all areas of the company and to all team members and helps to make important decisions in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activity: our team members individually shared their most important values. After clustering, a list of universal values surfaced. Some values seemed to be already ‘normal’ in our culture, whereas other ones could be categorised as either core values or aspirational values. We’ve rewritten both the core and aspirational values into phrases that resonate with everyone.</li>
  <li>Tool: post-its and Values Canvas (image below).</li>
  <li>Example: we deal with the challenge of balancing contentment about our work and the constant hunger for improvement. Introducing a tiny feedback mechanism, based on plus delta, helps us to seek 1% improvement every day. Every team member now knows what is means to do plus backspace.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../../../../uploads/Values&#32;Cheatsheet.001.png" alt="Values Cheatsheet.001.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Compass (mission)</strong>: what you want to achieve, for whom and how. Preferably in about 8 words. That’s a verb, target population and an outcome that’s measurable. Think of it as a mantra.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activity: use meditation and visualisation techniques to guide team through a personal envisioning of the future. Have everyone share their story and sketch it out, so all have an equal understanding of the content.</li>
  <li>Tool: visualisation, sketching.</li>
  <li>Example: for us, this activity revealed how we all see the entrepreneurs in our ventures and users of our technologies as the lever for change, over the technology itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-benefits-of-a-cultural-experiment">The benefits of a cultural experiment</h3>

<p>As emphasised earlier, we’re only sharing a journey here, instead of an outcome. The tools shouldn’t be the goal, they’re more of a starting point to put time and effort in nurturing a healthy company culture. So set your feet firmly on the ground, get that compass out and aim for that star. All to be relentlessly ambitious in breaking out of a short-term profit-maximising paradigm, into a world where purpose is the point and profit the result.</p>
